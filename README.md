# Scope
This project aims to test the ZED and ZED2i cameras and integrate them with a UWB radar, for SAR imaging. This is the code for the WALLRAD IGARSS 2023 Article.

# Stereo camera
In the first part, I mostly used ZED. To get better results, we changed it with a ZED2i.

# Detection Mode
The camera firstly detects the objects of interest, blue and green balls, for which I have trained them using the YOLO v8 algorithm.
